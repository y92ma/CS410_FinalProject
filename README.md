# CourseProject

This project mainly focused on applying state-of-the-art text retrieval methods on electronic medical records (EMR). 

To be specific, our project aims to build a text retrieval engine on a database of hospital discharge summaries to identify patients treated with certain diagnoses during hospital stay. For example, we may wish to find all patients treated with antibiotics of ceftriaxone for pneumonia during hospital stay by searching "pneumonia ceftriaxone".
