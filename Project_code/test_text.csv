22532,1246543,2154-08-33,,,Discharge summary,Report,,,"Admission Date [dsgsd] Service: ADDENUM: RADIOLOGIC STUIDES: From 1,800 feet in the air, the pilot of this tiny, four-seater plane points to a stretch of land marked by a smattering of farms and one arterial road.

“That’s the Wisconsin border,”  he says. “Doesn’t look like much from up here.”

But that sliver of land now marks a barrier between legal and illegal abortion care after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.

The pilot is part of a growing network of pilots who, through a fledgling Illinois nonprofit, are volunteering time, equipment and expertise to help connect people with abortion care. But there are risks, too, from antagonism and harassment from anti-abortion groups to potential legal threats, which is why the pilot asked that his name not be used in this story.

“Pilots take tremendous pride in the freedom we have to fly,” he says. “I can fly anywhere I want to. I don’t have to file a flight plan. I don’t have to talk to air traffic control. It felt right to use these freedoms to help someone whose freedoms are being threatened.”"
214032,112135,2133-05-12,,,Discharge summary,Report,,,"Jonathan Rodriguez had peers in high school who were homeless — but he didn’t know they were homeless until they shared that intimate detail with him.

“They try to hide it,” said Rodriguez, a student at Northwestern University.

Some homeless teens struggle with divorced parents, “or they just can’t make it home because of a bad situation,” he said. “It’s something that resonates with me.”

Rodriguez and over a dozen Chicago high school soccer players donated 1,000 sweatshirts Sunday at Lincoln Park Community Services, 1521 N. Sedgwick.

They collected the sweatshirts Friday at the not-for-profit Buddy’s Helpers’ annual college soccer recruiting event in McCook, where 200 players from across the state came together.

Rodriguez and others wanted the donation to highlight teen homelessness, which affected nearly 40,000 Illinois students in the last school year, according to the National Center for Homeless Education."
32510,1300,2100,,,Discharge summary,Report,,,"Dwindling federal funding for public health and low booster shot participation threatens to raise the COVID-19 risk once again in Chicago, according to Public Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady.

“COVID is not gone,” she said last week at an event promoting vaccinations on the Southwest Side.

This news comes at a time when the city’s risk for infection has been low to medium, with fewer hospitalizations and a dramatic decline in deaths from a year ago. Then, a new variant of the virus, omicron, was gaining steam and a deadly surge in cases loomed. More than 10,000 city residents were being diagnosed with COVID daily. More than 300 Chicagoans were being hospitalized daily last December and January, on average, and dozens were dying every day. Today, on average, around 400 Chicagoans are diagnosed with COVID-19 — and around 30 are hospitalized — each day, with a death rate of less than one per day.

But two factors risk undoing some of that progress."

This time, they began with arguably the biggest shock result they have ever garnered, over four-time world champions Germany. But their 2-1 win owes a lot to this side's ability to remain calm and make the sort of substitutions that change games."
10000,,,,,,,,,"So the first step in building a text search engine is assembling an inverted index. Let me explain what exactly that is. An inverted index is a data structure that maps tokens to the documents they appear in. In this context, we can consider a token to simply be a word, so an inverted index, at its most basic, is just something that takes in a word, and returns to us a list of the documents it appears in.

First, however, we have to parse and tokenize (split into words) our corpus of documents. We’ll do this as follows: for every document we want to add to our index, we’ll remove all punctuation and split it on whitespace, and create a temporary hashtable that maps filenames to their list of tokens. We’ll repeatedly transform this hashtable until we reach the final inverted index I described above (well, with one extra complication, but I’ll explain this). Here’s the code to do the initial text filtering:"
256000,,,,,,,,,"It has been an interminable month since Elon Musk assumed control of Twitter and showed up in its headquarters while carrying a bathroom sink. (In a leaden pun that foreshadowed what was to come, Musk tweeted, “let that sink in.”) The platform has since shed two-thirds of its workforce; lost half of its top hundred advertisers, including Citigroup, Merck pharmaceuticals, and Chevrolet; witnessed the rushed introduction and abrupt cancellation of a laughable subscription-payment scheme; reinstated the account of a former President who used the platform to promote a violent attack on the United States Capitol; and lost at least more than a million users. Last week, after fourteen years on the platform, I became one of them. Former Twitter users, like digital expats, have turned up on new shores—platforms such as Mastodon and Post News—with hopes of re-creating some semblance of their former online community minus the toxicity that sent them into exile. On November 20th, the Mastodon handle @LauraMartinez posted, “I’m here because Elon broke Twitter,” which was more of a summary of what a great many people felt about the old platform than a zealous endorsement of the buggy, complicated new one."
750200,,,,,,,,,"As a liturgical festival, Thanksgiving corresponds to the British and continental European harvest festival, with churches decorated with cornucopias, pumpkins, corn, wheat sheaves, and other harvest bounty. While the actual Thanksgiving holiday is on a Monday, Canadians may gather for their Thanksgiving feast on any day during the long weekend; however, Sunday is considered the most common. Foods traditionally served at Thanksgiving include roasted turkey, roast beef, ham, stuffing, mashed potatoes with gravy, sweet potatoes, cranberry sauce, sweet corn, various autumn vegetables (including various kinds of squashes, but also Brussels sprouts), pumpkin pie, apple pie, and glazed yams. Various regional dishes and desserts may also be served, including salmon, wild game, Jiggs dinner with split-pea pudding, butter tarts, and Nanaimo bars.[11]

In Canadian football, the Canadian Football League has usually held a nationally televised doubleheader, the Thanksgiving Day Classic. It is one of two weeks in which the league plays on Monday afternoons,[12] the other being the Labour Day Classic."
2604351,,,,,,,,,"Intel said Tuesday it has reduced potential stock payouts for CEO Pat Gelsinger after fielding complaints from investors. The cuts come as employees are bracing for layoffs across the company, part of a broader plan to reduce corporate spending.

The compensation changes reflect a desire “to further strengthen the alignment of Mr. Gelsinger’s new hire performance-based equity awards with his commitment to long-term stockholder value creation,” Intel said in a regulatory filing Tuesday.

In practice, though, the reforms could be mostly symbolic because Intel’s declining share price may have put many of Gelsinger’s stock awards out of reach.

Intel lured Gelsinger away from his job running software maker VMware last year with a compensation package valued at an extraordinary $179 million. Nearly all of that value came in stock bonuses Gelsinger would only receive if the company’s share price climbed."

""I have no idea what's next, but it was a gift of four years I'm grateful for and thanks to so many of you for being a part of it,"" wrote Neil Mohan, a creative partnerships lead in Toronto, in a LinkedIn post announcing his layoff alongside the broader Canadian team he worked on.

Meta spokesperson Alex Kucharski would not say how many Canadians were impacted by the cuts, but directed The Canadian Press to a public letter from founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, which said a total of about 11,000 workers would be departing."
